        description : "You want the soul mate, the happily ever after—the whole fairy tale. You love love. You believe you are single because you haven’t met the right person yet. Your motto: It’ll happen when it’s meant to happen.",
        tips: [
            "Our mindset matters! The ability to shift your mindset from soul mate to work-it-out beliefs could mean the difference between finding a life partner or not. People with soul mate beliefs reject promising partners because they don’t match their vision for what love should look and feel like. They think that love will just happen to them. They expect love to be effortless. If it’s not, they must be with the wrong person. People with a work-it-out mindset know that relationships take effort and that building a successful relationship is a process.", 
            "Our belief in fate and fairy tales—caused in part by Disney movies,rom-coms, and social media—creates unrealistic expectations for finding and sustaining relationships. Remember, no one is perfect, including you. Even Prince Charming has morning breath.", 
            "The Happily-Ever-After Fallacy is the mistaken idea that the hard work of love is finding someone. In reality, that’s only the beginning. Staying in love takes work, too. If you expect relationships to be easy, you’ll be caught off guard when they hit an inevitable rough patch. It’s time to embrace (and seek out) real love, scuffs and all!",

        description : "You love doing research, exploring all of your options, turning over everystone until you’re confident you’ve found the right one. You make decisions carefully. And you want to be 100 percent certain about something before you make your choice. Your motto: Why settle?",
        tips: [
            "Maximizers obsess over making the right decision. They want to explore every possible option before they make a choice. Even when they decide, they constantly wonder what they’re missing out on. Satisficers figure out what they want and stop looking once they’ve met their criteria. They don’t settle, they merely stop worrying what else is out there once they’ve made a decision.",
            "Research shows that Satisficers tend to be happier, because in the end, satisfaction comes from how you feel about your decision, not the decision itself.",
            "The current dating climate creates Maximizers out of many of us. No one ever seems good enough, and we wonder if we could be happier with someone else. Maximizing tendencies in relationships can lead to mental anguish, costly delays in decision-making, and missed opportunities.",
            "Maximizers assume there is a right answer for whom to be with. And there’s not. We can apply lessons from the Secretary Problem to see that we likely already have enough dating experience to select a great partner. This knowledge can help us commit without worrying about what else is out there. The power of rationalization can also help us embrace our decisions."

        tips: [
            "Hesitaters delay dating because they don’t feel 100 percent ready yet and want to put their best foot forward. But no one ever feels 100 percent ready for anything. At a certain point, you just have to start.",
            "Perfection is a lie. Everyone else is imperfect, too—even the person you’ll eventually end up with.",
            "By waiting to date, Hesitaters miss out on a chance to develop their dating skills and figure out what type of person they want to be with."
