## Inspiration
RelateConnect is inspired by the many youths that went through a relationship prematurely and ended up scarring themself. RelateConnect isn't an app like Tinder, Bumble, etc. but its focused towards those who wants to go on a healthy, commitful relationship but falls hesitant for whatever reason., hence we call it "The Dating Companion App". We feel this topic is rarely discussed because we view it as part of "puberty" but the roots of some toxic relationships, abusive relationships, starts from not caring about this particular topic. 

We followed one particular research from a Behavioural Scientist and Author "Logan Ury", we understood the "Three Tendencies of Dating" from her book "How To Not Die Alone". We based our database on her research and try to make it as objective as possible

We also followed our own personal experiences in dating, relationships w/o status, ending relationships prematurely, etc. to pursue the right features and find solutions to what could've been used back then. so you can bet your gits when we say it's personal and we want to make this work.
